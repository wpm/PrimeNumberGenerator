Prime Number Generator
======================
This generates primes numbers using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm proposed by Melissa E. O'Neill in "[The Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf)".

The [sbt-assembly plugin](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) is used to build executable JAR files.
